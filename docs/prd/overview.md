# CV Match - Product Overview

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

  * **For Users:** To significantly reduce the time and effort Digital Nomads spend creating and customizing CVs, ultimately increasing their interview requests.
  * **For the Business:** To validate the problem-solution fit for our AI-powered platform within the Digital Nomad niche and achieve a sustainable conversion rate from our "Single-Slot" freemium model.
  * **For the Project:** To define, build, and launch a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) with a low-cost Go-to-Market strategy, gathering the necessary traction to create a winning pitch for a startup competition.

### Background Context

Digital Nomads and remote professionals face a recurring and significant pain point: their professional history is fragmented across multiple online platforms like LinkedIn, GitHub, and Behance. Compiling this scattered data into a tailored CV for each new application is a tedious, manual process. Current resume builders act as simple template editors and fail to address this core data aggregation problem, leading to wasted hours and missed opportunities.

Our proposed solution is an AI-powered platform that acts as a central "career hub." Its core technology, the Model Context Protocol (MCP), automatically syncs and structures a user's professional data. This enables the rapid generation of a highly relevant CV tailored to a specific job description, shifting the user's effort from manual data entry to strategic refinement.
