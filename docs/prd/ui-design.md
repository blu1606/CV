# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision

The overall user experience will be **clean, efficient, and intelligent**. The interface should empower users by automating the tedious aspects of CV creation, allowing them to focus on strategic refinement. The design will prioritize clarity and speed, making the process of generating a tailored CV feel effortless and almost magical.

## Key Interaction Paradigms

  * **Automated Generation ("One-Click"):** A single button will initiate the primary workflow of generating a CV from a job description, delivering immediate and significant value.
  * **Modular Editing ("Lego-like"):** A core feature will be a two-panel layout with a component library on one side and the live CV draft on the other, enabling intuitive drag-and-drop customization.
  * **Real-time Feedback:** The "Match Score" will provide immediate and constant feedback on user actions, guiding them toward a better-optimized CV without being intrusive.
  * **In-context AI Assistance:** AI tools, like the rephrasing feature, will be available directly on the content they affect, rather than in a separate tool or chat window.

## Core Screens and Views

  * **Onboarding:** A streamlined, "LinkedIn-first" flow to provide instant value upon sign-up.
  * **Dashboard:** A central hub showing connected data sources, recent CVs, and key insights.
  * **Component Library:** A dedicated area for users to view and manage all their synced and manually created professional components (experiences, projects, skills).
  * **CV Editor:** The primary two-panel workspace for generating, editing, and refining CVs against a specific job description.
  * **Account Settings:** A page for managing profile information and connected data sources.

## Accessibility

  * **WCAG 2.1 Level AA:** The application will be designed and built to meet this widely accepted standard for web accessibility.

## Branding

  * The branding will be **modern, clean, and professional**. The aesthetic should convey intelligence and efficiency, using a focused color palette and clear typography to establish trust. It should feel like a premium, data-driven tool.

## Target Device and Platforms

  * **Web Responsive:** The application will be a responsive web app, optimized for a primary desktop experience, with full functionality on tablets.
